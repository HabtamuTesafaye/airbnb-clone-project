|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **users**             | `id`, `email`, `password`, `full_name`, `is_host`                | Stores all users including guests and hosts. `is_host` marks if a user can list properties. Passwords should be hashed securely.           |
| **properties**        | `id`, `title`, `location`, `price_per_night`, `user_id (FK)`     | Represents property listings owned by hosts. Stores essential info like price and location. Linked to the owner via `user_id`.             |
| **bookings**          | `id`, `property_id (FK)`, `user_id (FK)`, `check_in`, `check_out`, `status` | Stores reservations made by users for properties. The `status` tracks booking progress (pending, confirmed, cancelled).                    |
| **payments**          | `id`, `booking_id (FK)`, `amount`, `payment_status`, `transaction_reference`, `payment_method`, `timestamp` | Records payments linked to bookings. Stores method, status, and transaction info for auditing and refund handling.                         |
