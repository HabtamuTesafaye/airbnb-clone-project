## üß© Database Design

| Entity         | Key Fields                                                        |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Users**      | `id`, `email`, `password`, `full_name`, `is_host`                 |
| **Properties** | `id`, `title`, `location`, `price_per_night`, `user_id (FK)`      |
| **Bookings**   | `id`, `property_id (FK)`, `user_id (FK)`, `check_in`, `check_out` |
| **Reviews**    | `id`, `user_id (FK)`, `property_id (FK)`, `rating`, `comment`     |
| **Payments**   | `id`, `booking_id (FK)`, `amount`, `payment_status`, `timestamp`  |

**Relationships:**

* A **user** can own multiple **properties**.
* A **property** can have multiple **bookings** and **reviews**.
* A **booking** is linked to one **user**, one **property**, and one **payment**.
* A **review** is linked to one **user** and one **property**.

## üöÄ Feature Breakdown

* **User Management:** Allows secure sign-up, login, and profile management with token-based authentication.
* **Property Listings:** Hosts can list properties with details like price, location, and images.
* **Booking System:** Enables users to check availability and book properties with date validation.
* **Payment Integration:** Processes payments and stores transaction history securely.
* **Reviews:** Lets users provide feedback and ratings for properties they stayed at.
* **API Documentation:** Built using OpenAPI and GraphQL for interactive exploration.
* **Data Optimization:** Indexing and caching are used to enhance performance and scalability.

## üîê API Security

* **Authentication:** Token-based (JWT/session) authentication for all protected routes.
* **Authorization:** Role-based access control ensuring only owners can modify their content.
* **Rate Limiting:** Prevents abuse by throttling excessive API calls.
* **Input Validation:** Protects against injection attacks and malformed data.
* **Secure Payments:** Ensures encrypted transactions and storage of sensitive data.

Security is critical to:

* Protect **user data**.
* Prevent **unauthorized bookings or changes**.
* Ensure **safe financial transactions**.

## ‚öôÔ∏è CI/CD Pipeline

* **What is CI/CD?**
  Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) automates testing and deployment of code, ensuring reliability and consistency.

* **Tools Used:**

  * **GitHub Actions:** Runs tests, lints code, and deploys on every push.
  * **Docker:** Ensures the environment is consistent across all stages.
  * **PostgreSQL + Redis Containers:** Used for automated test environments.
